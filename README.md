Iv'e started this project to learn nextjs's new app router (extensive experience with pages router), golang (completely new) and docker (somewhat new).
Additionaly I wanted to experiment with real world production-ready app's problems such as setting up dev environment with docker including hot module reloading, mounting & persisting data on local disk and setting up docker secrets.
